## System Requirements

This tutorial assumes you already have [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your computer.

SocialGene was developed and tested on Ubuntu Linux. Because everything is Conda-ized/Docker-ized I see no reason that would prevent it from working on Mac or Windows given you have Conda and Docker successfully installed on those systems; that said, support for those OSs will be minimal.



## Setting up SocialGene with Make

There is a [Makefile](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile) in the top directory that makes it easy to perform a majority (if not all) of the things you might want to do.
