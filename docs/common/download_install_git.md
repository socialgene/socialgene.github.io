## Conda

The easiest/most sure way to run examples shown in the documentation will be to just have all dependencies installed. The easiest way to do that is to install everything using Conda.

If you don't already have COnda installed, you can install Miniconda from here:
<https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>

To install the socialgene conda package:

```bash

conda env create --file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/socialgene/sgnf/main/conda_environment.yml

```
