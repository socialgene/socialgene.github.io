# Overview

## What does this do?

The general flow starts with creating a SocialGene Neo4j database. This is done using the Nextflow pipeline which handles...

- Downloading proteins and/or genomes from NCBI, MIBiG, etc, or using local genomes (genbank format)
- Downloading HMM models from multiple sources (or using local HMMs) and upconverting to the latest HMMER format (optional)
- Creating and HMM-annotating a set of non-redundant proteins from the input proteins/genomes (optional)
- Comparing input proteins via all-vs-all DIAMOND BLASTp (optional) and/or MMseqs2 clustering (optional)
- Annotating input genomes with antiSMASH (optional)
- Creating/Transforming all the necessary data and input files for import into a Neo4j graph database
- Importing/Creating the Neo4j graph database (optional)
- And more...

Most steps are optional which allows you to customize your database to your needs.

## What is the output?

1. Output files for the processing steps. e.g. BLASTp database, MMseqs2 index, non-redundant HMM model file, etc.
2. All final output files ate tab separated, gzipped files which are imported into Neo4j but could be used 
3. A Neo4j database containing all the data and relationships

The Neo4j database can be interacted with in multiple ways including:

1. Through the SocialGene Python package (or Neo4j's Python package or other drivers)
2. Through SocialGene's Django application (web-based GUI)
3. Using "Neo4j Browser" or directly from a number of other tools that use or have Neo4j plugins (Cytoscape, Gephi, yFiles/yWorks, etc.)

## Components

1. A Nextflow/nf-core pipeline (<a href="https://github.com/socialgene/sgnf" target="_blank">github.com/socialgene/sgnf</a>)
    - If you are trying to create your own SocialGene database this is where you want to start
    - It coordinates data download, manipulation and the creation of a SocialGene database
2. A Python library (<a href="https://github.com/socialgene/sgpy" target="_blank">github.com/socialgene/sgpy</a>)
    - Contains the code for most of the data transformations used to build the database
    - Contains functions for manipulation sequence, domain, and genomic context data
    - Contains functions for manipulating SocialGene/Neo4j databases 
        - e.g. adding antismash results and MIBiG metadata which require graph-modifications so can't be directly imported within the Nextflow pipeline
<!-- 
3. A Django web server (<a href="https://github.com/socialgene/sgweb" target="_blank">github.com/socialgene/sgweb</a>)
    - Currently a very basic GUI for submitting/coordinating pre-built database queries
    - Relatively simple to set up locally using `docker compose`
    - Currently there aren't plans to make a public server but that could change -->

## Citations

Citing software is important because it helps developers justify to granting bodies (or bosses) that their software is useful and should be funded.

Socialgene should be cited as:

Additionally, any run of the Nextflow pipeline will create a citations of all additional software used:
